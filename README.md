# SinkSabre

An alternative to the (recently removed) Beat Saber sync function provided by BMBF and BeatSaver for ~~Meta~~ Oculus Quest.

This is a [Compose Multiplatform](https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-multiplatform) application, and supports both **direct install to Quest** and **running on desktop** (tested on Linux only, but Windows should work in theory).

## Features
- Upload to and download from several sources:
    - BeatSaver account bookmarks
    - BeatSaver playlists
- (Mostly) VR-friendly interface
- Launch Beat Saber from within application
- View maps added in the current session
- View local maps
- View bookmarked maps

> [!NOTE]
> BeatSaver accounts registered using Discord cannot be used. Sync using a playlist instead.
